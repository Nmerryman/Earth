# Earth Tetris Bot

This is my first real try at building a tetris bot that can interact with the browser to play the game

The final results ended with a bot that could play at a maximum speed of placing one piece per second and survive until the game became to unfavorable.

Percausions were taken to understand and not violate any community guidelines in the testing and the use of this program.
